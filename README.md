Hello to my Repo!

Hello and welcome to my repository!
I'm excited to share the materials I've uploaded for an automated testing course. 
These include tutorials, code samples, and documentation to help you get started with automated testing. 
Additionally, I've included some of my own projects that I've developed using various testing tools such as Selenium and TestNG.
With these projects, I've achieved faster and more accurate testing results, which has greatly improved the quality of our software. 
If you have any questions or feedback on my projects, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
Thank you, and have a pleasant day
